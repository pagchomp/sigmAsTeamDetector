# sigmA's Team Detector

This tool scans the "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/server_log.txt" file for changes and when changes are found it queries the stratzAPI for data on both allies and enemies and ultimately creates an HTML table with relevant data.  
Feel free to use the python script--or else the zip file contains an exe that shouldn't require python (although it hasn't been tested in it's modern form, it should work)
