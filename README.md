# sigmA's Team Detector

This tool scans the "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/server_log.txt" file for changes and when changes are found it queries the stratzAPI for data on both allies and enemies and ultimately creates an HTML table with relevant data.  
Still VERY much so in development.
